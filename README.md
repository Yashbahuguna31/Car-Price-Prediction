# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, mileage, engine size, and more. The process includes data cleaning, filling missing values, performing data analysis to gain insights, and using a Random Forest Regressor model with hyperparameter tuning for predictions.

## Features
  Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and preparing the dataset for analysis.

  Data Analysis: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights from the data.

  Model Training: Training a Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

  Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.

  Prediction: Making predictions on new car data.
